# Model Code & Inputs

## Notes:
Model setup is provided by an ASPECT input file and a WorldBuilder file (https://github.com/GeodynamicWorldBuilder/WorldBuilder). Minor modifications to the ASPECT source code were implemented and are discussed in the associated publication as well as the `model_code_inputs/README.md` directory.
